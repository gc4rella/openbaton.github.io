## OpenBaton
OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification. 

## What is NFV  
ETSI NFV represents a concerted telco operator initiative fostering the development of virtual network infrastructures by porting and further adapting network functions to the specific cloud environment. 
ETSI NFV has defined a large set of virtualisation use cases, spanning from the cloudification of the main core network functions such as IMS, Evolved Packet Core, and Radio Access Networks, as well as providing on demand and complete virtualised infrastructures as IaaS or PaaS to third partie, such as enterprises and professional radio. 
That enables providing elastic deployments of cost efficient network infrastructures.
One of the main concerns of ETSI NFV is to prove the feasibility of the cloud deployments of the typical network functions through proof of concept trials and prototypes as well as providing indications for further standardization in the areas of underlying infrastructures, software architectures, networking and management, and orchestration to improve performance and grant security of the overall infrastructure.
ETSI NFV limits itself to this level of indications, considering that other standardization bodies and de-facto open source standards such as 3GPP and OpenStack should finalize the specific implementation work. 

## Its main components
OpenBaton provides the following components: 
* A Network Function Virtualisation Orchestrator (NFVO) completely designed and implemented following the ETSI MANO specification
* A generic Virtual Network Function Manager (VNFM) able to manage the lifecycle of VNFs based on their descriptors
* A set of libraries which could be used for building your own VNFM
