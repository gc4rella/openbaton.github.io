                    whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.
                    Disabling Cookies
                    <br>

                    From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is

                    The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft)
                    takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. When we process the personal data that is
                    collected during your visits to our Web site, we always observe the rules laid down in the
                    applicable data protection laws. Your data will not be disclosed publicly by us, nor transferred to
                    any third parties without your consent.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>1. Recording and processing of data in connection with access over the Internet</b><br>
                    When you visit our Web site, our Web server makes a temporary record of each access and stores it in
                    a log file. The following data are recorded, and stored until an automatic deletion date:
                <ul>
                    <li>IP address of the requesting processor</li>
                    <li>Date and time of access</li>
                    <li>Name and URL of the downloaded file</li>
                    <li>Volume of data transmitted</li>
                    <li>Indication whether download was successful</li>
                    <li>Data identifying the browser software and operating system</li>
                    <li>Web site from which our site was accessed</li>
                    <li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
                </ul>
                The purpose of recording these data is to allow use of the Web site (connection setup), for system
                security, for technical administration of the network infrastructure and in order to op-timize our
                Internet service. The IP address is only evaluated in the event of fraudulent access to the network
                infrastructure of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
                <br>
                Apart from the special cases cited above, we do not process personal data without first obtaining your
                explicit consent to do so. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created as stated under web analysis (see
                below).

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>​2. Orders</b><br>
                If you order information material or other goods via our website, we will use the address data provided
                only for the purpose of processing your order.

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>3. Use and transfer of personal data</b><br>
                All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only under-taken to the
                extent necessary for these purposes. Your data is not disclosed to third parties.
                <br>
                Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to
                comply with mandatory national legislation or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order
                to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure. Personal data will not
                be transferred for any other purpose.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>4. Consent to use data in other contexts</b><br>

                The use of certain services on our website, such as newsletters or discussion forums, may re-quire prior
                registration and involves a more substantial processing of personal data, such as longer-term storage of
                e-mail addresses, user IDs and passwords. We use such data only insofar as it has been sent to us by you
                in person and you have given us your express prior consent for this use. For example, we request your
                consent separately in the following cases:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>4.1 Newsletters and press distribution</b><br>

                In order to register for a newsletter service provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least
                your e-mail address so that we know where to send the newsletter. All other information you supply is on
                a voluntary basis, and will be only if you give your consent, for example to contact you directly or
                clear up questions concerning your e-mail address. If you request delivery by post, we need your postal
                address. If you ask to be included on a press distribution list, we need to know which publication you
                work for, to allow us to check whether specific publications are actually receiving our press material.
                <br>
                As a general rule, we employ the double opt-in method for the registration. In other words, after you
                have registered for the service and informed us of your e-mail address, you will receive an e-mail in
                return from us, containing a link that you must use to con-firm your registration. Your registration and
                confirmation will be recorded. The newsletter will not be sent until this has been done. This procedure
                is used to ensure that only you yourself can register with the newsletter service under the specified
                e-mail address. You must confirm your registration as soon as possible after receiving our e-mail,
                otherwise your registration and e-mail address will be erased from our database. Until we receive your
                confirmation, our newsletter service will refuse to accept any other registration re-quests using this
                e-mail address.
                <br>
                You can cancel subscriptions to our newsletters at any time. To do so, either send us an e-mail or
                follow the link at the end of the newsletter.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>​4.2 Visitors’ books and forums</b><br>
                If you wish to sign up for an Internet forum run by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, we need at least a user
                ID, a password, and your e-mail address. For your own protection, the reg-istration procedure for this
                type of service, like that for the newsletters, involves you con-firming your request using the link
                contained in the e-mail we send you and you giving your consent to the use of further personal data
                where this is necessary to use the forum.
                <br>
                You can cancel your registration for this type of service at any time, by sending us an e-mail via the
                Web page offering the service.
                <br>
                As a general rule, the content of visitors’ books and forums is not subject to any form of monitoring by
                the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to delete posted contributions and to
                prohibit users from further use of the service at our own dis-cretion, especially in cases where posted
                content contravenes the law or is deemed in-compatible with the objectives of the
                Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
                <br>
                <br>

                <b>5. Cookies</b><br>
                We don’t normally use cookies on our Web site, but in certain exceptional cases we may use cookies which
                place technical session-control data in your browser’s memory. These data are automatically erased at
                the latest when you close your browser.
                <br>
                If, exceptionally, one of our applications requires the storage of personal data in a cookie, for
                instance a user ID, we will point out you to it.
                <br>
                Of course, it is perfectly possible to consult our Web site without the use of cookies. Please note,
                however, that most browsers are programmed to accept cookies in their de-fault configuration. You can
                prevent this by changing the appropriate setting in the browser options. If you set the browser to
                refuse all cookies, this may restrict your use of certain functions on our Website
                <br>
                <br>

                <b>6. Web analysis</b><br>
                Personal user profiles are not created. However, Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG) permits the
                use of user profiles under a pseudonym for the purpose of advertising, market research and the
                structuring of offers in line with the user's needs provided that the user does not object to this:
                <br>
                We also use web analysis services on our web pages, for example from etracker or WiredMinds, which carry
                out the web analysis on our behalf as contract processors (see the websites of www.wiredminds.de for
                these providers). Their services have been checked by the supervisory authorities and/or experts and
                meet all requirements under German and European data protection laws.

                Using the technologies of these providers, data is collected and stored on our website. From this data,
                user profiles are produced under a pseudonym for marketing and optimi-zation purposes, for which cookies
                may be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache memory of the site
                visitor's web browser. The cookies enable the web browser to be recognized. Furthermore, your user
                behavior can be measured via a JavaScript code and data collected in this connection can be sent
                directly to the provider's servers in Germany or the EU via an HTML connection. Without your express
                consent, the data collected using the tracking technologies will not be used to personally identify you
                and will not be combined with the personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. No cross-website
                analysis will be carried out either.
                <br>
                <br> If you wish to technically stop the tracking, you can deactivate JavaScript and cookies in your web
                browser. Consent for the collection and storage of data can also be refused with effect for the future
                at any time. Please follow this link to refuse the service provided by WiredMinds:

                <b>7. Social plugins</b><br>
                We also use social plugins in some cases on our webpages, e.g. from the Facebook, Twit-ter, YouTube or
                Google+ social networks. These are often technically operated in the USA or in other countries outside
                Germany and the EU and some are offered via national companies in the EU (see the websites
                www.facebook.de, www.twitter.de, www.youtube.de or www.google.de for the providers). The plugins are
                identified with the companies’ logo, comment fields or what are known as a “Like” or “+1” button.
                <br>
                If you open a page of our website in your web browser containing such a plugin, your web browser will
                create a direct connection to the servers of the respective provider in the country concerned.
                <br>
                By incorporating the plugins the provider is given at the least the information that you have visited a
                certain page on our website, and perhaps also other information that your web browser or the device you
                use also discloses. The content of the plugin is loaded by your web browser directly from the provider
                and incorporated into our website. If you are registered and have logged in with the provider concerned,
                your visit can also be assigned to your user account.
                <br>
                If you interact with a plugin, e.g. if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form
                field, your browser will also transmit this information directly to the provider where it will be saved
                and, if applicable, continue to be used and published.
                <br>
                Above all, marketing measures of the provider and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are the reason for the
                collection and use of the data as described and determine the extent of this. You can find details on
                this and on your rights and on ways in which you can pre-vent the collection and use of your data in
                order to protect your private sphere directly in the data privacy policy of the respective provider.
                <br>
                If you do not wish a provider to collect data on you through our website you must deacti-vate the
                plugins in your web browser. If you wish to avoid a link to any existing user account, you must log out
                before your visit to our website. By visiting our website, you de-clare your consent to the above
                provisions.

                <b>8. Security </b><br>
                The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard
                stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against
                access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously im-proved in line with
                technological progress.

                Our Web pages may contain links to other providers’ Web pages. We would like to point out that this
                statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the Web pages managed by the

                data protection, nor do we carry out any checks to ensure that they conform with the relevant
                legislation.

                their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use.
                <br>
                In some cases, if you are a registered user of certain services provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft,
                we offer you the possibility of inspecting these data online, and even of deleting or modifying the data
                yourself, via a user account.
